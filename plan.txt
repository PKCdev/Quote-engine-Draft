> Great—let’s shape a practical, flexible quote engine around your Microvellum reports. Below is a concise blueprint we can
  iterate on, plus key questions to tailor it to your workflow.

  Goals

  - Turn Microvellum reports into accurate, explainable quotes.
  - Factor in materials, hardware, machining, edgebanding, labor, install, overhead, margin, and tax.
  - Keep rules configurable so you can calibrate over time.
  - Produce a clean client-facing quote with optional alternates.

  Expected Inputs

  - Microvellum exports: likely CSV/Excel (cutlists, parts, hardware, edgeband edges, drilling/pockets, assemblies).
  - Cost catalogs:
      - Materials: price per sheet/area, sheet size, waste/yield.
      - Edgeband: price per meter/roll, thickness/width, setup + per-meter time.
      - Hardware: SKU mapping, unit price, package rounding, waste.
      - Machine rates: CNC hourly, edge-bander hourly, saw hourly.
      - Labor rates: assembly, finishing, install.
  - Project configs: taxes, overhead, margin policy, delivery, install hours, rounding rules.

  Cost Model (first pass)

  - Panels/materials:
      - Area-based: total area / sheet area / yield + waste% OR sheet-based with optimizer-style rounding.
      - Add material-specific surcharges (grain-matched, HPL, veneer).
  - Edgebanding:
      - Sum linear length per band spec; cost = length × price + setup.
      - Time = setup + length × time_per_meter; charge machine rate or labor.
  - Machining:
      - Drilling = holes × time_per_hole; pocketing = area × time_per_area; per-part setup options.
      - Machine charge = machine_time × machine_rate.
  - Hardware:
      - Sum(qty × unit price) with min pack and waste.
  - Assembly/finishing:
      - Base hours per cabinet type + adders for drawers/doors/complexity.
      - Finishing by area and finish system (stain, paint, clear).
  - Install and logistics:
      - Travel, onsite hours, per-cabinet install time, per-room adders.
  - Overhead:
      - As % of labor/machine or per-project flat.
  - Margin and tax:
      - Target margin per category or blended; regional tax rules.
  - Rounding:
      - Per line or total (nearest $1/$5/$10) with psychological pricing options.

  Architecture

  - Importers: adapters for Microvellum CSV/Excel schemas.
  - Normalizer: map MV fields to a canonical model (materials, parts, edges, ops, hardware, assemblies/rooms).
  - Mapper: configurable mapping from MV text to your catalogs (e.g., “White Mel 3/4” → Material: MEL-19MM-WHITE).
  - Rules Engine: YAML/JSON formulas referencing normalized fields, with per-project overrides.
  - Calculators: category-specific calculators (materials, edgeband, machining, hardware, labor).
  - Aggregator: roll up by cabinet/room/project; produce cost breakdown and diagnostics.
  - Output:
      - Internal: detailed breakdown CSV/Excel/JSON.
      - Client: clean quote PDF/Excel with optional alternates and inclusions/exclusions.

  Data Model (core entities)

  - Project: client info, site, taxes, margins, currency, date.
  - Assembly/Cabinet: type, dimensions, room, finish, count.
  - Part: material, thickness, L×W, qty, edge specs, grain.
  - Edge: edge code, length, band type/width/thickness.
  - Operation: type (drill, pocket, dado, route), counts/areas.
  - HardwareItem: code, description, qty, unit price, package size.
  - Catalogs: materials, bands, hardware SKUs, machine rates, labor rates with effective dates.
  - Rules: cost/time formulas and coefficients.

  Workflow

  - Import MV export → Normalize → Map to catalogs → Apply rules → Compute category costs and times → Apply overhead, margin,
  tax → Generate outputs.
  - Scenario support: tweak waste, rates, or substitutions and compare versions.

  Open Questions

  - Which MV report formats do you use (CSV, Excel, XML)? Can you share a redacted sample?
  - What columns do you get for edgebanding (edge flags, lengths, band type)?
  - Do you get operation detail (holes, pockets, toolpaths) or just totals?
  - Units (imperial/metric)? Typical sheet sizes?
  - Existing price lists for materials/hardware? How often do prices change?
  - Labor strategy: time standards available or start with heuristics we’ll calibrate?
  - Do you include install and delivery? How should we model them?
  - Preferred markup policy (margin by category vs blended)? Rounding rules?
  - Output preference: Excel and PDF? Group by room or by cabinet type?
  - Tech preference: CLI-only initially, or a small local web UI later?

  MVP Proposal

  - CLI that reads one MV CSV/Excel, one YAML config for catalogs + rules.
  - Implements materials, edgebanding, hardware, basic machining, assembly labor.
  - Outputs:
      - Detailed breakdown CSV (per cabinet/room).
      - Client quote Excel (summary + options).
  - Configurable coefficients for quick calibration.

  Implementation Plan (phased)

  - Gather sample exports and define the canonical schema.
  - Define catalogs and mapping YAMLs.
  - Implement importer/normalizer for your export.
  - Build calculators and rule definitions.
  - Produce breakdown and quote outputs.
  - Validate with one recent project and calibrate.

  If you can share a redacted sample export and a simple materials/hardware price list (even rough), I’ll scaffold the repo
  with the schema, config templates, and the first parser. Would you prefer a Python-based CLI for the MVP?
